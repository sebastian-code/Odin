Odin a simple Learning Content Management System (LCMS), made for the needs of Hack Bulgaria courses. 

It contains the following modules:
* Courses - a simple module that describes a course
* Students - it overrides the default django user model and adds some usefull staff. Every student can be assigned to a course. 
* Notes - teachers can add notes to students. Notes can be later exported to a pdf file, which represents the profile of the student
* Form - a simple forum app that uses markdown for displaying content.
* More ideas soon...
